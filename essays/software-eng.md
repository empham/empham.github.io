> Software engineers apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or client.

As a Computer Engineering major, the career paths available to me are diverse and plentiful. Some students go on to work in the hardware industry, designing and building the next generation of computers. Others go into software, building AI models, maintaining databases, and so on. As for me, I am currently undecided on which path I will take, but this semester's ICS 314, Software Engineering, might win me over.

## **Why would I want to be a Software Engineer?**
My relationship with engineering began with questions. While using Google Docs to complete my high school homework, I would find myself asking "why doesn't this feature exists?" When my sister wanted to buy a limited edition Switch and had to check everyday to see if they restocked, I thought "Can't you make an app that does that?" (The answer is you can through web scraping!) "How are computers put together?," "What is RAM?" Answering questions, or in other words solving problems, is the job of an engineer, thus I decided to pursue a degree in computer engineering.

The jump from computer engineering to software engineering is not a far one. To be a successful hardware designer, one needs to be aware of what current software demands. Being conscientious of how the hardware and software interacts is also a necessity. Likewise, software designers must be aware of the hardware constraints of their target devices. Therefore to accel in my field, I must have a firm grasp on both.

## **My roadmap to my future as an engineer**
The only way to progress forward is through learning and experience. In terms of software engineering, I hope to gain a firm grasp of the fundamental concepts in class. To supplement this, I want to get as much hands on experience as possible. The structure of ICS 314 is perfect for this, with its many practice exercises and coding challenges (see this [essay](/essays/ics314_death.html) for more details). In future projects, internships or jobs I hope to learn what it is like to be a part of a larger-scale project. Slowly bu surely, I want to gather the stepping stones that build the path to my future as an engineer.
