As AI tools become increasingly accessible and powerful, they will certainly become an integral part of our lives. This holds especially true for those of us involved with the tech industry. In this essay I will explore the use of AI in education and reflect on my personal experiences.

## **Where does AI fit in?**
If you, like me, were a student when chatGPT was released, your school, similar to mine, must have released many statements oh the use of AI in completing assignments. More often than not there was a line in the syllabus of every class that read something like this:

"Students are expected to complete their own work. Using AI to complete assignments is considered cheating and will result in a failing grade."

While I understand the sentiment, I believe this rejection of AI is a missed opportunity which could eventually turn into a disadvantage for students. It will undeniably be necessary to understand how to wield these tools in the *near* future. Coming from a computer engineering student background, AI is not only a tool that can check work, answer questions, breakdown topics and provide detailed examples, but is also something we study init of itself. On one hand it can allow students to complete assignments without actually learning the material, but on the other hand it can be used to significantly enhance the learning experience.

## **A List Summarizing my Personal Experience with AI**
Before the list, a personal encounter with AI. While studying abroad last year, I had the privilege of taking a class on Technology and Architecture in which the professor was well educated in the current state of AI. He made it a point of the class to analyze the ways in which this new technology affects our lives, thereby architecture, and encouraged the use and discussion of such tools. It was an incredible class and really pushed me to be aware of AI.

Now onto a list of my personal experiences with AI this semseter:

*  **Experience WODs e.g. E18, In-class Practice WODs, and In-class WODs**
    I've grouped these three topics as my experience across them all are quite similar. I began the ICS 314 course without the aid of any AI based tools. However approximately 3 weeks into the course I experienced my first, and ony, DNF (did not finish) for an in-class WOD. It was then that a classmate suggested I try GitHub CoPilot. See, in this WOD I had understood the problem and had an algorithm for the solution in mind, but I ended up getting stuck due to syntax errors. GitHub CoPilot has almost completely erased this issue for me and I have not DNF'ed since. I have tried chatGPT once, but I've always found prompting it to be too time consuming when compared to google and my brain.
*  **Essays**
    ChatGPT is instantly the first AI tool that comes to mind for this topic. While I have used it to give ideas, correct grammar, or reword sentences for other essays, I've never used it for an ICS 314 essay.
*  **Final project**
    For the final project I have been using GitHub CoPilot as it has become a natural part of my workflow for ICS 314. I believe it has increased my efficiency without detracting from my understanding of the material.
*  **Learning a concept / tutorial**
    I rarely use chatGPT to learn anything, rather my use of AI would fall under one of the other categories.
*  **Answering a question in class or in Discord**
    I rarely answer questions in either situation and subsequently haven't really used AI for these things.
*  **Asking or answering a smart-question**
    While it may not fit the exact definition of "smart-question" as I have discussed in a previous essay, I have found there is a right and a wrong way to prompt chatGPT. Whenever I ask a question I try to give as detailed a context as possible and limit the format of the answer. Additionally, I try to probe for answers one at a time. In doing so I have been able to get reasonably helpful answers from chatGPT.
*  **Coding example (e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”) and Explaining code**
    Yes, yes, yes! I love asking chatGPT to provide examples of code. I also typically ask it to provide a detailed breakdown of the code. It has been incredibly helpful in understanding the material. Even when it is unable to fully provide the answers I am looking for, it often times gives me an idea of where to look next.
*  **Writing code**
    I have not used chatGPT to write code, but I have used GitHub CoPilot to write code. I have found it to be incredibly helpful in writing code, as I've explained above.
*  **Documenting code**
    I prefer to document all my code myself. It is essential to my understanding of the material, so if I can't explain it myself, I know I need to research it more.
*  **Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code [code here]” or “Fix the ESLint errors in [code here]”**
    Again yes! I would say my answer follows the same logic as when I ask any other question about code.
*  **Other uses in ICS 314 not listed**
    While random, I have been using Japanese Siri to practice my Japanese. Ever since returning from abroad, my changes to speak have decrease exponentially. I have found that asking Siri to do things in Japanese has helped me to keep my Japanese skills sharp.

## **Impacts, Applications, and Challenges**
AI has, and will continue to have, a significant impact in the realm of education. It is a growing field of study, and as the technology continues to mature it will be increasingly be present in the classroom and the world around us. It already is used in robots, personal assistants, targeted ad delivery, and even assignment grading. It also has the ability to be a great learning assistant that can tailor course contents to a students preferred learning method. However it is a double edge sword. When abused AI can bypass the learning process and allow students to pass classes without truly understanding the material. There are two main paths to combat this, (1) ban the use of AI and stick to the current methods of teaching or (2) adapt the class in such a way that the use of AI alone will not be enough to pass. While (1) is the easiest to implement now, it has holes that will continue to grow as AI matures. 

On the topic of maturing AI, it is important to note that AI is not perfect. It is still in its infancy and has a long way to go. oftentimes it can spread misinformation or be unable to complete tasks that are trivial to humans. While this remains a barrier to the widespread integration of AI, with time I am sure engineers and great minds will overcome these challenges.

## **Future Considerations & Conclusion**
In the future I see AI becoming a regular part of software engineering education. Just as we learn how to use various tools, applications, and development environments, we will also learn to use AI. I imagine it will one day handle almost all of the basics of writing code, allowing engineers to focus in on things like algorithms and top level design. It will be a slow and challenging process, but I believe it will be worth it.

If there is any singular message within all of this I would say it is this: 

When leveraged correctly, AI is a powerful tool that enhances learning and life. Rather than pushing it away, we should embrace and add it to the toolbox, but never let it replace the engineer using it.

However if chatGPT were to summarize this essay, it says:

"The essay reflects on the author's experiences using AI tools such as GitHub CoPilot and ChatGPT in education, discussing their potential benefits in tasks like coding and learning, while cautioning against potential misuse and acknowledging the current imperfections and challenges associated with AI integration in education."
