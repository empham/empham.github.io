"Rules are the rules!" As functioning members of society we all must follow rules. Whether it be the law, social etiquette, or scientific principles, rules are everywhere. In the world of software engineering, coding standards are the rules that govern how code is written. The existence of these rules create a common ground allowing for easy production and collaboration.

<h2 id="from-chaos-rose-order"><strong>From chaos rose order</strong></h2>
<p>In a world without coding standards, project codebases were a battlefield where programmer’s would pit their unique coding styles against on another. Fiery debates over the placement of curly braces, the use of tabs vs spaces, and the naming of variables would rage on for days. THe resulting codebase was a chimera of various styles put together. It was hard to read and maintain, truly a monster that grew everyday. 
<br />
Then there was the birth of coding standards. Developers made peace, and codebases were like purebred puppies. The code was easy to read and maintain, and from that time on coding standards became the rules of the software world. The end.</p>

<div><b>The rules of ICS 314 (a.k.a. ESLint)</b></div>

<p>Although the name suggests it, coding standards are not equal across all languages and groups. Instead there tends to be a few standards for each language that are widely used. From there each company/group may choose to specialize the standards to their needs. <br />
For my ICS 314 class we have chosen to used ESLint to enforce the AirBnb Javascript standard. The use of an “enforcer” is essential to the adherence of coding standards. The less effort it takes on the part of the coder, the more likely they will adhere. Without tools like ESLint I would have to memorize all the rules and check the guidebook manually every time I write code. Overall I find the system setup in this class efficient and effective. Additionally it streamlines the way I learn JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-rules-should-be-followed"><strong>Why the rules should be followed</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - code authored by different people reads the same</li>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> - reviews, refactoring, and debugging are easier</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - when working in teams, less time is wasted trying to understand code</li>
  <li><strong>Learning</strong> - the rules provided a framework on how to learn the language</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-the-rules-should-be-broken"><strong>When the rules should be broken</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specialization</strong> - just because one standard works for one team, it is important to find what works best for your team</li>
  <li><strong>Improvements</strong> - although one coding standard may be the best at the time, it is important to reevaluate and make changes when necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>Coding standards are the rules of a Software Engineer’s life, and I personally don’t want to live in a world without them.</p>
