## **A Pause to Reflect**
I began this semester with some vague understandings of software engineering, and a lot of hopes for what I would learn in ICS 314: Software Engineering. As the semester comes to a close, it only seems fitting to reflect on my journey here, and look forward to the future.
<br /> 

While reminiscing on the long nights of coding, cold-sweat inducing WODs, and challenging projects, I am reminded of the reason I continue to enjoy computer engineering. Its the satisfaction of my code working after hours of debugging. the excitement of new challenges. And, above all, the new knowledge I gain with each experience. In this essay I wanted to highlight some of the key concepts I've learned in ICS 314.

## **Integrated Development Environments (IDE)**
The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is one of the greatest tools in a software engineer's arsenal. IDEs are software applications that provide a comprehensive set of integrated tools for software development. They always include a text editor, while additional tools include: compiler, debugger, file manager, version control, and more. ICS 314 was the first class in which using an IDE was a part of the curriculum. Until this class I had simply been using one or two IDEs once in a while, but only as glorified text editors.

Now that I have learned to take full advantage of IntellijIDEA, I can't imagine coding without an IDE. While the learning curve is quite steep in the beginning, the payoff is worth it. The best example of this is keyboard shortcuts. learning all the specific inputs is a time consuming process, but when it comes time to code it allows quick access of features without breaking my workflow. My favorite part about the IDE is the linter. Providing immediate feedback and suggestions has sped up my development process and improved the quality of my code.

When a development environment is setup correctly, it allows an engineer to put all their focus into their code. This is why IDEs are essential for software engineers.

## **Project Management & Agile Development**
The first time I heard the term "agile development" was while listening to [The Rabbit Hole](https://www.stridenyc.com/podcasts/rabbit-hole) podcast. It is a term I've often heard thrown around in the industry, but I had never used it myself. "Agile development" refers to any management structure that is based on breaking down a project into a finite number of short cycles (often called sprints). 

ICS 314's "issue driven project management" was my first experience with agile development. While my team's execution of the process was not perfect, I learned a lot about the benefits of agile development. Having set deadlines (milestones) helped keep the entire team on the same page and naturally led up to do a review meeting the day of the milestone. I also found having issues organized on a kanban board(see below) allowed me grasp the state of the project in a quick glance. An area my group could improve on is the generation of issues. we chose to create issues as we went along, but this led to us losing sight of our end goal. This is something I would like to improve on in the future. Overall I found the development style blended well with my work style and I hope to use it in future projects.

## **Standards, Quality Assurance, and Conventions**
Over the course of the semester I've encountered, and implemented, a variety of coding standards and conventions. The first of these was the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). I go more into detail about this and my overall experience in my previous [essay](https://empham.github.io/essays/code-stand.html). But more than just the standards themselves, I think implementing them prepared me for the concept of quality assurance. Quality assurance goes beyond coding standards by incorporating the need for testing and continuous integration. In the setting of ICS 314 this was done using testcafe and GitHub Actions. Despite how tedious and time-consuming writing tests can be, I've come to appreciate the value of quality assurance. It not only gives users confidence in the product, but helps developers catch any breaks early on.

Through ICS 314 I have grasped the essence of these practice, and have the confidence to implement them in future projects.

## **Conclusion**
ICS 314 has been a class where I've matured a lot as a software engineer. It has opened my eyes to the many facets of software engineering. Moving forward I hope to take the tools I've learned and hone my skills with them.
