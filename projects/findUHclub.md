SCADA stands for 'Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition,' and it represents a type of control system architecture. During my time in the lab, I served as one of two Linux system administrators. We were tasked with programming and maintaining a multitude of Raspberry Pis that acted as access points within our system. For example, we setup some Pis to be our DHCP, DNS and NTP servers. On our lab's wiki, we created and maintained all documentation relevant to our work. A sample of one of the pages is given in the image below.
